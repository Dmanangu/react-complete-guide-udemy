Why react use components 
	- its main function is for the reusability
		- Avoid repition of data

	- separation of concerns.
		- Keeping codebase small and manageable 
		- small separate units and one clear specific task

	- split big chunks of code into multiple smaller function
	
React Code is written in a declarative way
	- user interfaces are about HTML, CSS and JavaScript
	- its all about components
	- react allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JavaScript and CSS
	
	Supports Declarative Approach
		- Define the desired target State(s) and let React figure out the actual
		JavaScript DOM instructions

What is JSX code
	- HTML code inside of JavaScript
	- JSX = JavaScript XML
	- HTML is the end is XML

Components
	- Capital characters when a component is inside this folder
	- execute certain block of codes/ command
	- component in react is just a JavaScript function
	- lower case elemenent are built in HTML elements
	- Upper case element are JavaScript codes
	
	- must contain 1 root element
	- const is a variable that does not change

Passing Data via Props:
	- props passes data in the components by adding an attribute
	- then get access to all these attributes which has been set
	- with react out own custom components can also have attributes
	- then it is now called props instead of attributes
	
	Data from components should not be stored inside of but instead outside of it
	- react will ensure that we get one parameter
	- props in short for properties
	- best practice to keep your component small and focused
